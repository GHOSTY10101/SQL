-- GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING
-- GROUP BY
-- In SQL, the GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows.

use amazon;

-- Example A: GROUP BY using HAVING
SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS category_count
FROM products
GROUP BY category
HAVING category_count > 5;

-- Example B: GROUP BY using CONCAT
-- Group Concat is used in MySQL to get concatenated values of expressions with more than one result per column.
SELECT supplier, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT pname) AS product_list
FROM products
GROUP BY supplier;

-- Example C: GROUP BY with AVG
-- Group by can be used with aggregate functions like COUNT, MAX, MIN, AVG, SUM, etc.
SELECT location, AVG(price) AS average_price
FROM products
GROUP BY location;

-- ORDER BY
-- Used for ordering rows in a specific way

-- Example A: ORDER BY in Ascending Order
SELECT pid, pname, price
FROM products
ORDER BY price ASC;

-- Example B: ORDER BY in Descending Order
SELECT cid, cname, age
FROM customer
ORDER BY age DESC;

-- HAVING
-- The HAVING clause in SQL is used in conjunction with the GROUP BY clause to filter groups based on a specified condition.

-- Example A: Products with an average rating greater than 4
SELECT pname, AVG(rating) AS avg_rating
FROM reviews
GROUP BY pname
HAVING avg_rating > 4;

-- Example B: Locations with total sales greater than 100000
SELECT location, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY location
HAVING total_sales > 100000;

-- QUESTIONS

-- GROUP BY:
-- 1) Write a query to find the total sales for each product.
SELECT pname, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY pname;

-- 2) Write a query to find the number of customers in each age range (e.g., 0-18, 19-35, 36-50, 50+).
SELECT CASE
    WHEN age BETWEEN 0 AND 18 THEN '0-18'
    WHEN age BETWEEN 19 AND 35 THEN '19-35'
    WHEN age BETWEEN 36 AND 50 THEN '36-50'
    ELSE '50+'
    END AS age_range, COUNT(*) AS customer_count
FROM customer
GROUP BY age_range;

-- 3) Write a query to find the average order amount grouped by customer city.
SELECT city, AVG(order_amount) AS avg_order_amount
FROM orders
GROUP BY city;

-- ORDER BY:
-- 1) Write a query to retrieve all products ordered by their name in ascending order.
SELECT *
FROM products
ORDER BY pname ASC;

-- 2) Write a query to retrieve all orders ordered by their date in descending order.
SELECT *
FROM orders
ORDER BY order_date DESC;

-- 3) Write a query to retrieve all employees ordered by their department and then by their salary in ascending order.
SELECT *
FROM employees
ORDER BY department, salary ASC;

-- HAVING:
-- 1) Write a query to find the suppliers who supply more than 50 different products.
SELECT supplier, COUNT(DISTINCT pname) AS product_count
FROM products
GROUP BY supplier
HAVING product_count > 50;

-- 2) Write a query to find the customers who have placed more than 5 orders.
SELECT cid, cname, COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY cid, cname
HAVING order_count > 5;

-- 3) Write a query to find the stores with an average customer rating between 3 and 4.
SELECT store_id, AVG(customer_rating) AS avg_rating
FROM store_reviews
GROUP BY store_id
HAVING avg_rating BETWEEN 3 AND 4;

-- DQL COMMANDS
-- 1) DQL stands for Data Query Language.

-- SELECT
-- Used to retrieve rows selected from one or more tables.
-- SELECT can be used in many ways:

-- A) SELECT With DISTINCT Clause
-- The DISTINCT Clause after SELECT eliminates duplicate rows from the result set.
SELECT DISTINCT cname, addr 
FROM customer;

-- B) SELECT all columns(*)
SELECT * 
FROM orders;

-- C) SELECT by column name
SELECT oid 
FROM orders;

-- D) SELECT with LIKE(%)
-- Helps in searching using parts of the name.

-- a) "Ra" anywhere
SELECT * 
FROM customer 
WHERE cname LIKE "%Ra%";

-- b) Begins With "Ra"
SELECT * 
FROM customer 
WHERE cname LIKE "Ra%";

-- c) Ends With "vi"
SELECT * 
FROM customer 
WHERE cname LIKE "%vi";

-- E) SELECT with CASE or IF
-- a) CASE
SELECT cid, cname,
       CASE 
           WHEN cid > 102 THEN 'Pass' 
           ELSE 'Fail' 
       END AS Remark
FROM customer;

-- b) IF
SELECT cid, cname,
       IF(cid > 102, 'Pass', 'Fail') AS Remark
FROM customer;

-- F) SELECT with a LIMIT Clause
SELECT * 
FROM customer
ORDER BY cid
LIMIT 2;

-- G) SELECT with WHERE
SELECT * 
FROM customer 
WHERE cname = "Ravi";

# ANSWERS
/* 
String Functions:
1) The CONCAT() function is used to concatenate (combine) two or more string values. Example: SELECT CONCAT('Hello', ' ', 'World'); will output "Hello World".
2) Both LCASE() and LOWER() convert a string to lowercase letters. LOWER() is the standard SQL function, while LCASE() is a MySQL-specific alias. It's generally recommended to use LOWER() for better portability across different databases.
3) To extract a substring from the 5th position to the 10th position (inclusive) from "Hello, World!", you can use the SUBSTR() function: SELECT SUBSTR('Hello, World!', 5, 6); This will output "o, Wor".
4) The LPAD() function pads a string with a specified string on the left side to make it a certain length. RPAD() does the same but on the right side. Example: SELECT LPAD('Hello', 10, '*'); will output "*****Hello".
5) To trim both leading and trailing spaces from ' Hello, World! ', you can use the TRIM() function: SELECT TRIM(' Hello, World! '); This will output "Hello, World!".

Date and Time Functions:
1) CURRENT_DATE() returns the current date, while SYSDATE() returns the current date and time.
2) To calculate the number of days between '2023-06-15' and '2023-07-20', you can use the DATEDIFF() function: SELECT DATEDIFF('2023-07-20', '2023-06-15'); This will output 35.
3) The LAST_DAY() function returns the last day of the month for a given date. Example: SELECT LAST_DAY('2023-05-01'); will output "2023-05-31".
4) To add 3 months to the current date, you can use the ADDDATE() or DATE_ADD() function: SELECT ADDDATE(CURRENT_DATE(),

 INTERVAL 3 MONTH);
5) To extract the time component from a datetime value, you can use the TIME() function: SELECT TIME('2023-05-01 12:34:56'); This will output "12:34:56".

Numeric Functions:
1) AVG() calculates the average value of a set of values, while COUNT() returns the number of rows/values. AVG() is used to find the mean, and COUNT() is used to count the number of rows or non-null values.
2) To calculate the square root of 144, you can use the SQRT() function: SELECT SQRT(144); This will output 12.
3) To round the number 3.14159 to two decimal places, you can use the ROUND() function: SELECT ROUND(3.14159, 2); This will output 3.14.
4) The MIN() function returns the minimum value, and the MAX() function returns the maximum value in a group of values. Example with GROUP BY: SELECT MIN(price) AS min_price, MAX(price) AS max_price, category FROM products GROUP BY category;
5) To calculate the power of 2 raised to the 5th power, you can use the POW() function: SELECT POW(2, 5); This will output 32.
